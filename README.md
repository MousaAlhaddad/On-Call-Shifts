# Scheduling On Call Shifts
This is about a program that aims for making a fair on-call schedule that suits everyone in the medical team. 

> On Calls.py uses the data stored on OnCalls.xlsx which contains the names of the rotating residents' names and the dates on which they do not prefer having on-calls. It then generates a random schedule that suits everyone. 

> Note: that you need to specify the variables nP (number of participants) and nD (number of days) before running the script.

> For nP = 8 and nD = 30 (default values), the output file -On-Call Schedule.xlsx- will contain 4 shifts for 6 random persons and 3 shifts for the remaining 2 individuals.
